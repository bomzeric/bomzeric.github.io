    <p>
      Coccinellidae is a widespread family of small beetles. They are commonly
      known as ladybugs in North America and ladybirds in the United Kingdom
    </p>
    <h2>Ladybugs types:</h2>
    <p>Asian Lady Beetles:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>May be orange or yellow, but can also be red.</li>
      <li>Can have an "M" shape on their head.</li>
      <li>May bite humans and release a yellow liquid when disturbed.</li>
      <li>Tend to overwinter indoors, often in large numbers.</li>
      <li>Can be invasive, potentially outcompeting native ladybug species.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Native ladybugs:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Generally red with black spots.</li>
      <li>Do not bite humans.</li>
      <li>Overwinter outdoors in sheltered spots.</li>
      <li>Beneficial insects, eating plant pests.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Most coccinellid species are carnivorous predators, preying on insects such as aphids and scale insects. Other species are known to consume non-animal matter, including plants and fungi. They are promiscuous breeders, reproducing in spring and summer in temperate regions and during the wet season in tropical regions. Many predatory species lay their eggs near colonies of prey, providing their larvae with a food source. Like most insects, they develop from larva to pupa to adult. Temperate species hibernate and diapause during the winter; tropical species are dormant during the dry season. Coccinellids migrate between dormancy and breeding sites.</p>
